        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this page was stress. In the moment of stress it felt as if my lungs were not taking in enough air. I came to the realization my breaths were  short. I decided to create this page for others who may find themselves taking short breaths. Go ahead, take the time to reset your breathing.
